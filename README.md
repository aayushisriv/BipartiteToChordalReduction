# BipartiteToChordalReduction
Convert Any Bipartite Graph to Chordal Graph using Reduction via Chain Graph
Input is Number of nodes in first part, second part of bipartite graph, number of edges in bipartite graph.
It will convert the bipartite graph to chain graph using ranking heuristic.
Then convert chain graph to chordal graph by making both sides of graph as cliques while using maximum neighborhood heuristic.
Output is a chordal graph.(Blue edges for chain graph and green edges for chordal graph)
